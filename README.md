## Tell Me About Yourself
I’m a senior software engineer with around 15 years of experience, mostly building large-scale systems that need to stay reliable when demand spikes. 

Currently at Sainsbury’s, I work on event-driven microservices on AWS and Kubernetes, using Kafka and Spring Boot to support customer-facing platforms running at real retail scale. My focus is on resilience, observability, and making sure services behave well in production — not just in design documents. 

Before that, I spent several years at Cognizant, designing distributed payment systems for BNYN, Mastercard and Visa, leading teams and setting architecture standards around security, performance, and fault tolerance. What excites me most is working at massive scale, where small engineering decisions affect millions of people every day, and where teams succeed by collaborating and getting the fundamentals right. 


Mic-drop: I don’t just ship features — I build platforms teams trust and customers never have to think about.
