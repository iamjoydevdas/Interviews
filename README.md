# Interviews

## Tell Me About Yourself
Yeah, so I’m a Senior Software Engineer with about 15 years of experience, mostly working on large backend systems.

At the moment, I’m at Sainsbury’s. I work on Java and Spring Boot microservices that run on AWS and Kubernetes, supporting customer-facing retail platforms. A big part of my job is making sure things run properly in production — reliability, monitoring, performance, and handling incidents when they happen.

Before that, I was at Cognizant, working on distributed systems for large enterprise clients like BNY Mellon, Mastercard, and Visa. I also spent time mentoring engineers across different teams.

In my day-to-day work, I usually own services end to end — from designing and building them to deploying, monitoring, and fixing issues, including doing root cause analysis. I work closely with product managers and other stakeholders and take responsibility for what I deliver.

I’m mainly backend-focused, but I’m comfortable working full-stack when needed and working closely with frontend teams to deliver complete customer experiences.

Overall, I enjoy building systems that teams can trust and that customers don’t really have to think about, where strong basics keep systems reliable as they grow.
## Do you have experience owning production systems?
```angular2html
Yes. I own services end-to-end — from development and deployment to monitoring, 
incident investigation, and root-cause analysis.
I regularly use New Relic, Grafana, and Kibana to track system health
```

## Have you worked in payments before?
```dockerfile
Not directly in payments, but the systems I work on have very similar challenges 
— high throughput, reliability, event-driven architecture, and strict production SLAs. 

Those patterns transfer very well to payments systems.
```

## What are you looking for in your next role?
```
I’m looking for a role where I can work on large-scale, business-critical systems and continue growing in event-driven and distributed architectures.

In my current role I enjoy owning services end-to-end — 
from design and development through to production support — 
and I want to keep that level of ownership while working at even higher scale.

The Payments domain is particularly interesting to me because reliability, 
correctness, and resilience really matter, and the challenges align well with the kind of 
systems I enjoy building.

I’m also looking for a team with strong engineering practices and a culture of learning, 
where I can both contribute my experience and continue to grow technically.
```

## Why are you leaving xxxxxx’s?
```dockerfile
I’ve had a positive experience at Sainsbury’s and learned a lot there.

Over time, I’ve realised that I’m looking for a role where I can work on larger-scale,
 more complex systems and continue growing technically.

I’m now at a point in my career where I want to challenge myself further and 
broaden my experience, rather than move because of any negative reasons.
