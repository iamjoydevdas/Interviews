# Interviews

## Tell Me About Yourself
I’m a Senior Software Engineer with around 15 years of experience building large-scale backend systems.

Currently at Sainsbury’s, I work on Java and Spring Boot microservices running on AWS and Kubernetes, supporting customer-facing retail platforms. My focus is on production readiness — reliability, observability, performance, and incident handling.

Before that, I worked on distributed systems at Cognizant for large enterprise clients including BNY Mellon, Mastercard, and Visa, and I also mentor engineers across teams. I enjoy owning services end to end and working on systems where scale and reliability really matter.

Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience designing, building, and operating high-availability, fault-tolerant distributed systems across retail, fintech, and payments domains.

Currently at Sainsbury’s, I work on backend microservices using Java and Spring Boot, deployed on AWS and Kubernetes, supporting customer-facing platforms at real retail scale. My focus is on event-driven systems, production readiness, observability, and resilience—ensuring services behave reliably under peak demand, not just in design documents.

Previously at Cognizant, I worked on distributed payment systems for clients including BNY Mellon, Mastercard, and Visa, contributing to architecture decisions around security, performance, and fault tolerance, and mentoring engineers across teams.

I regularly own services end-to-end—from design and implementation to deployment, monitoring, incident response, and RCA. I enjoy mentoring junior engineers, collaborating closely with product and stakeholders, and taking clear ownership of product-facing services. While primarily backend-focused, I’m comfortable working full-stack when needed and partnering with frontend teams to deliver complete customer experiences.

I’m motivated by building platforms teams can trust and systems customers never have to think about, where strong engineering fundamentals make a real impact at scale.

## Do you have experience owning production systems?
```angular2html
Yes. I own services end-to-end — from development and deployment to monitoring, 
incident investigation, and root-cause analysis.
I regularly use New Relic, Grafana, and Kibana to track system health
```

## Have you worked in payments before?
```dockerfile
Not directly in payments, but the systems I work on have very similar challenges 
— high throughput, reliability, event-driven architecture, and strict production SLAs. 

Those patterns transfer very well to payments systems.
```

## What are you looking for in your next role?
```
I’m looking for a role where I can work on large-scale, business-critical systems and continue growing in event-driven and distributed architectures.

In my current role I enjoy owning services end-to-end — 
from design and development through to production support — 
and I want to keep that level of ownership while working at even higher scale.

The Payments domain is particularly interesting to me because reliability, 
correctness, and resilience really matter, and the challenges align well with the kind of 
systems I enjoy building.

I’m also looking for a team with strong engineering practices and a culture of learning, 
where I can both contribute my experience and continue to grow technically.

## Why are you leaving xxxxxx’s?
```dockerfile
I’ve had a positive experience at Sainsbury’s and learned a lot there.

Over time, I’ve realised that I’m looking for a role where I can work on larger-scale,
 more complex systems and continue growing technically.

I’m now at a point in my career where I want to challenge myself further and 
broaden my experience, rather than move because of any negative reasons.
