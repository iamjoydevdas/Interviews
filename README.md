## Tell Me About Yourself
```
I’m a senior software engineer with around 15 years of experience, mostly building large-scale systems that need to stay reliable when demand spikes. 

Currently at Sainsbury’s, I work on event-driven microservices on AWS and Kubernetes, using Kafka and Spring Boot to support customer-facing platforms running at real retail scale. My focus is on resilience, observability, and making sure services behave well in production — not just in design documents. 

Before that, I spent several years at Cognizant, designing distributed payment systems for BNYN, Mastercard and Visa, leading teams and setting architecture standards around security, performance, and fault tolerance. What excites me most is working at massive scale, where small engineering decisions affect millions of people every day, and where teams succeed by collaborating and getting the fundamentals right. 


Mic-drop: I don’t just ship features — I build platforms teams trust and customers never have to think about.
```
or 
```angular2html
Sure. I work as a Senior Java Engineer at Sainsbury’s, mainly on backend microservices.

I build and maintain Java and Spring Boot services, design event-driven flows using Kafka, 
and deploy everything on AWS and Kubernetes.

I also focus a lot on production readiness — monitoring, performance testing, 
and incident resolution — and I mentor juniors within the team

## Do you have experience owning production systems?
```angular2html
Yes. I own services end-to-end — from development and deployment to monitoring, 
incident investigation, and root-cause analysis.
I regularly use New Relic, Grafana, and Kibana to track system health
```

## Have you worked in payments before?
```dockerfile
Not directly in payments, but the systems I work on have very similar challenges 
— high throughput, reliability, event-driven architecture, and strict production SLAs. 

Those patterns transfer very well to payments systems.
```

## What are you looking for in your next role?
```
I’m looking for a role where I can work on large-scale, business-critical systems and continue growing in event-driven and distributed architectures.

In my current role I enjoy owning services end-to-end — from design and development through to production support — and I want to keep that level of ownership while working at even higher scale.

The Payments domain is particularly interesting to me because reliability, correctness, and resilience really matter, and the challenges align well with the kind of systems I enjoy building.

I’m also looking for a team with strong engineering practices and a culture of learning, where I can both contribute my experience and continue to grow technically.
